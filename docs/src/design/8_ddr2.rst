.. flat-table:: Signal trace length delay constraints
   :header-rows: 1
   :width: 100%

   * - Constraint
     - Description

   * - LC1
     - All data, address and command signals must be followed within +- 50ps

   * - LC2
     - Intra-pair mismatch +- 2ps

   * - LC3
     - Inter-pair mismatch +- 5ps

   * - LC4
     - Intra-byte-group mismatch +- 10ps

CLK and DQS intra-pair and inter-pair mismatches are ignored as they are exactly length matched.

CLK, DQS, Data and DM signals are routed on the same layer (L6) and are length matched to 0.03mm (2.1ps<10ps).

Signals on L3/L6 shall be matched to 23.9150mm +- 5mm (35ps<50ps))

Signals on L8 shall be matched to 23.9150mm +- 7mm (35ps<50ps))
