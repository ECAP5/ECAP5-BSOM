   * - Constraint
     - Description

   * - LC1
     - Mismatch within DAT0~DAT7+DS <= 41ps

   * - LC2
     - CLK to DAT0~7+DS mismatch <= 41ps

   * - LC3
     - CLK to CMD mismatch <= 41ps

   * - LC4
     - CLK to RST_N mismatch <= 166ps

.. note:: Signals applicable to LC1 will be matched to the longest one of them

All signals are routed on layers L1/L6 which share the same propagation speed, and the number of vias has been matched so the signals are length matched with 41ps leading to <= 7.246mm and 166ps leading to <= 29.337mm.
